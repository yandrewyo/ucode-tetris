# ucode-tetris
Early UCode project using HTML/CSS/JS

Uses javascript to manipulate HTML div elements.
Local storage to store highscores and keybinds.
Leaderboard page unfortunately does not work anymore. Used to use firestore to rank scores from multiple devices.

Game Description:
Enter keybinds in index.html before proceeding to the game. Soft drop moves the piece down one tile. Hard drop moves the piece all the way to the bottom. Save swaps the piece in play with an already saved piece. The first use of save simply saves the piece and moves on to the next one. Complete an entire row to score points. Different point values are rewarded for different numbers of rows completed using a single piece.

Known Bugs:
Using the first save and saving again in succession makes the piece dissapear from the saved piece view, but is still technically there. Leaderboard no longer functions.
